# IEEE-UAlbany-Server-Frontend

This project is still under development. Must be a club member in the UAlbany IEEE Discord server to interact.

A free cloud hosting service for UAlbany IEEE club members. Backend created with React (Typescript).

A live version of the website can be found at https://ieeeualbany.herokuapp.com/

# Features

## Side-by-side Discord integration

Being a Discord-oriented organization, users must interface with the IEEE Server Discord bot to communicate with the server.

(Disclaimer: By tying your Discord account to the server, only your Discord profile name, avatar, ID, and email will be logged, which most Discord bots have access to already. You can remove this information any time by contacting the server administrator.)


## Build and compare your portfolio
* Have your projects easily accessible to show off
* See what projects your peers are working on by searching their Discord name
* Members who upload a project to the server get the "Server Contributor" role to distinguish themself
