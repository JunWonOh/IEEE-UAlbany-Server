# IEEE-UAlbany-Server-Frontend

This project is still under development. Must be a club member in the UAlbany IEEE Discord server to interact.

A free cloud hosting service for UAlbany IEEE club members. Backend created with React (Typescript).

A live version of the website can be found at https://ieeeualbany.herokuapp.com/

# Features

## Side-by-side Discord integration

Being a Discord-oriented organization, users must interface with the IEEE Server Discord bot to communicate with the server.

(Disclaimer: By tying your Discord account to the server, only your Discord profile name, avatar, ID, and email will be logged, which most Discord bots have access to already. You can remove this information any time by contacting the server administrator.)


## Build and compare your portfolio
* Have your projects easily accessible to show off
* See what projects your peers are working on by searching their Discord name
* Members who upload a project to the server get the "Server Contributor" role to distinguish themself

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
